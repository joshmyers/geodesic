# Geodesic


![Geodesic](docs/geodesic-small.png)

Geodesic is the fastest way to get up and running with a rock solid, production grade cloud platform built entirely from Open Source technologies. 

It’s a swiss army knife for creating and building consistent platforms to be shared across a team environment.

It easily versions staging environments in a repeatable manner that can be followed by any team member.

It's a way of doing things that allows companies to collaborate on infrastructure (~snowflakes~) and radically reduce Total Cost of Ownership.

It provides a fully customizable framework for defining and building cloud infrastructures backed by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). It couples best-of-breed technologies with engineering best-practices to equip organizations with the tooling that enables clusters to be spun up in record time without compromising security. 

It's works natively with Mac OSX, Linux, and [Windows 10 (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Introduction

These days, the typical software application is distributed as a docker image and run as a container. Why should infrastructure be any different? Since everything we write is "Infrastructure as Code", we believe that it should be treated the same way. This is the "Geodesic Way". Use containers+envs instead of unconventional wrappers, complicated folder structures and symlink hacks. Geodesic is the container for all your infrastructure automation needs.

## NAME

about - About the Geodesic Cloud Automation Shell

## FEATURES

* **Secure** - TLS/PKI, OAuth2, MFA Everywhere, remote access VPN, [ultra secure bastion/jumphost](https://github.com/cloudposse/bastion) with audit capabilities and slack notifications, [IAM assumed roles](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/), automatic key rotation, encryption at rest, and VPCs
* **Repeatable** - 100% Infrastructure-as-Code with change automation and support for scriptable admin tasks in any language, including Terraform
* **Extensible** - A framework where everything can be extended to work the way you want to
* **OpenSource** - Permissive [APACHE 2.0](LICENSE) license means no lock-in and no on-going license fees

## TECHNOLOGIES

At its core, Geodesic is a framework for provisioning cloud infrastructure and the applications that sit on top of it. We leverage as many existing tools as possible to facilitate cloud fabrication and administration. We're like the connective tissue that sits between all of the components of a modern cloud.

* [`atlantis`](https://www.runatlantis.io/) - GitOps style operations by Pull Request. Ideal for terraform, helm and helmfile.
* [`aws-vault`](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault) for securely storing and accessing AWS credentials in an encrypted vault for the purpose of assuming IAM roles
* [`aws-cli`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/) for interacting directly with the AWS APIs
* [`chamber`](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber) for managing secrets with AWS SSM+KMS and exposing them as environment variables
* [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) for managing environment variables per project or globally
* [`gomplate`](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate/) for template rendering configuration files using the GoLang template engine. Supports lots of local and remote datasources
* [`goofys`](https://github.com/kahing/goofys/) a high-performance Amazon S3 file system for mounting encrypted S3 buckets that store cluster configurations and secrets
* [`terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) for provisioning miscellaneous resources on pretty much any cloud
* [`tmate`](https://tmate.io) for remote terminal sharing with other engineers (pairing) and collaborative debugging
